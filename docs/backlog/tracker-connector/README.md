# Tracker connector — work items in, worc tasks out

Status: **ready-to-implement** Date: 2026-09-10 Owner: Vladimir Makarevich Slug: `tracker-connector`

## Summary

A separate, optionally installed package, `worc-connect`, watches an issue tracker for one repository, turns each work item a maintainer has explicitly gated into a worc task through the ingress worc already has (`tasks/preparing/` + `worc promote`), and writes the outcome back to the tracker — a state label, a comment naming the task, the pull-request link, and the close on merge. GitHub is the first tracker, driven through the operator's own `gh` login; the connector's core knows no tracker API, so Azure DevOps, GitLab or Jira are one adapter each behind an optional dependency. Triage by an agent (analyse, reproduce, write a failing test) is an **optional** mechanic switched off in v1 — v1 exists to prove the connector mechanics fast, and it needs **no change to worc at all**. Four worc-side contract items are specified here too, none on v1's critical path: a `references:` task field that worc appends verbatim to the PR body (so a connector can say `Fixes #142` without worc learning any tracker's syntax); `pr_url` and a `rejected` section in `worc list --format json` (so the connector learns a task's PR and a gate reject's reason from the one scripting surface, never from `.worc/`); and a configurable report directory that the private report policy may point outside `.worc/`, so the optional triage flow can leave its report in the connector's own home.

The connector lives in its own repository, `VladimirMakarevich/worc-connect` (created empty and private on 2026-09-11, bootstrapped by phase 03). This folder is the connector's copy of the design record; the worc-side phases (01, 02, 08) and their phase documents stay in the orchestrator repository's copy, and the two copies are kept in step by hand.

These documents are design detail, not an implementation contract, and must not override the hard invariants in `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `.agents/rules/`. The code remains the source of truth; this folder leaves the queue once the work lands.

## How this task is being worked

At the user's request every document was drafted in one pass, from the design conversation that preceded it, instead of one document at a time. On 2026-09-10 the documents were verified against the code (`dev` at `ea8467d`) and corrected; on 2026-09-11 the user answered the last open question, signed off every row above and set the folder to `ready-to-implement`. [questions.md](questions.md) keeps the record of every decision. Implementation order: phases 01, 02 and 08 here (independent of each other, branches off `dev`), phases 03 → 04 → 05 in the connector repository, then 06 and 07 once their dependencies have merged — see [plan/README.md](plan/README.md).

## Change log

- 2026-09-11 — connector phase 03 landed in this repository (the skeleton: configuration, gate, state, loop, the GitHub adapter's read side and the dry run). The three worc-side phases 01, 02 and 08 merged into the orchestrator's `dev`, so phases 06 and 07 wait on nothing outside this repository.
- 2026-09-10 — spec folder scaffolded and every document drafted in one pass; branch `chore/spec-tracker-connector` off `dev`.
- 2026-09-10 — user fixed the name (`worc-connect`) and the home (`.worc-connect/`) and accepted the defaults for Q-3…Q-10; D14 added for the owner editing, retitling, reopening and merging a published PR by hand (FR-C16/FR-C17, AC-16/AC-17/AC-E9, happy-path Example 4, phase 05 steps); Q-11 opened for the follow-up-on-open-PR default.
- 2026-09-10 — pre-implementation review against the code (`dev` at `ea8467d`): D11 / phase 02 resolved (the PR URL is the completed `pr` publish-op's `result_ref`, read by the existing `_recorded_pr_url`; no new column); phase 01 pinned to `NodeInputs` / `build_node_inputs`, the gate's check order (`INVALID_REFERENCES` before the injection scan) and the reused-PR path; doc targets corrected to `packaged/guide/README.md` + `tasks/task-rich.md` (no operations page exists); `worc list --all` semantics and status labels made explicit in FR-C12 / AC-W2 / AC-12; `promote`'s stdout signal recorded; the default-gitignored lifecycle tree (`worc install`, same day) reflected in problem / D4 / happy-path; gate rejects verified to leave no `tasks` row → Q-12 opened, AC-E3 and control-flow step 4 rewritten around it. Sign-off still pending on every row.
- 2026-09-10 — user decided Q-11 (**yes**, follow-up continues the open PR) and Q-12 (**option b**): a third worc-side item, FR-W3 / D15 / AC-W3 — `worc list --format json --all` gains a `rejected` section read from the ledger, built in phase 02 and adopted by the connector in phase 06. Only Q-6 stays open (phase 07). Nothing committed; the folder awaits the user's sign-off.
- 2026-09-11 — user decided Q-6: the triage report goes to the connector's own home through worc's configurable report directory, allowed for the private policy outside `.worc/` (D16, FR-W4, AC-W4, new worc phase 08; phase 07 now depends on it; the `configurable-report-dir.md` backlog row is absorbed). User signed off every document and set the status to `ready-to-implement`. Connector repository `VladimirMakarevich/worc-connect` created (private, empty; briefly named `worc-connect-github` and renamed the same day once D1's one-repository layout — core plus adapters as extras — was reconfirmed). Nothing committed.
