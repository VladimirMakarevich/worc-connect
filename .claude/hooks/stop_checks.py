"""Stop-hook quality gate for worc-connect.

Runs the *fast* checks (ruff + pytest) when a Claude Code turn ends, so the suite stays green during
development. If anything is red, it blocks the stop and feeds the failure back to Claude
(``decision: block``) so the cause is fixed on the next turn. A loop guard (``stop_hook_active``)
surfaces a red gate at most once per stop-cycle — it never spins. ``mypy`` is left to the heavier
``/run-checks`` gate (run before a commit / PR / phase transition).

Cross-platform: invoked as ``python .claude/hooks/stop_checks.py`` (works under PowerShell and
bash); sub-checks run via ``sys.executable -m ...`` so they use the same interpreter that has the
project's dev deps installed.
