"""Lint this repository's Markdown corpus with wastech-mdlint.

One entry point for the local shell and the pre-commit hook, so both run the same corpus with the
same rules rather than two hand-written command lines that drift. Two responsibilities justify a
script instead of a bare command:

* **Finding the linter.** It is not published to a package registry, so there is no dependency copy
  in this repository and no bin on PATH to rely on. Resolution is env var, then a sibling checkout,
  then a local install if one ever exists — reported explicitly, never guessed silently.
* **Covering both branch states.** The shared config describes the corpus that exists on every
  branch; the branch carrying the derived documentation adds a second, additive config for the
  rules that presuppose it. Running the shared config plus every overlay that is actually present
  makes the command correct on either branch with no branch-name logic anywhere.

Exit codes mirror the linter's own: ``0`` clean, ``1`` findings, ``2`` operational failure. A linter
that cannot be found is a skip with a note, so committing a typo fix never requires a Node toolchain
— but not under ``CI``, where the same case is a hard failure, because an automated caller that
reports success for a gate it never ran is worse than a red one.
